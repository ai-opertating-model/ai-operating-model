# Phased Approach to Data Governance

## Principles of Data Governance

### Drive from Business Use Cases
Data governance should be driven by real business needs rather than theoretical ideals. Begin with high-value use cases that demonstrate tangible benefits. This ensures governance activities directly contribute to business outcomes and maintain stakeholder support.

### Focus on Capturing Context from the Business and Process
Context is critical for data understanding and proper usage. Capture not just the technical metadata but the business context around data - why it exists, how it's used, what decisions it influences, and its relationship to business processes. This context enables users to interpret and apply data appropriately.

### Automate Wherever Possible to Reduce Friction
Data governance should enhance, not impede, business operations. Automate governance processes where feasible - from metadata collection to quality monitoring and policy enforcement. This reduces manual effort, improves consistency, and increases adoption by making governance less burdensome.

### Data Modeling is Key - Use the Medallion Architecture Where Possible
A thoughtful data modeling approach provides the foundation for effective governance. The medallion architecture (bronze/silver/gold layers) offers a structured approach to data refinement, with increasing quality and business value at each stage. This architecture supports both governance needs and analytical flexibility.

## Phase 1: Foundation

### Self-Assessment
#### Data/AI Strategy
1. Have we clearly articulated how data supports our business objectives?
2. Do we have executive sponsorship for our data/AI initiatives?
3. Have we identified key metrics to measure the success of our data strategy?
4. Is our data strategy aligned with our overall business strategy?
5. Have we established baseline data maturity benchmarks?

#### Data Model Approach
1. Have we documented our current data architecture and model approach?
2. Do we have naming conventions and modeling standards in place?
3. Have we identified our critical data entities and their relationships?
4. Is there a process for approving changes to core data models?
5. Have we assessed the scalability of our current data model approach?

#### Data Policies
1. Do we have clear policies defining data ownership and accountability?
2. Have we established data classification guidelines?
3. Do our policies address regulatory compliance requirements?
4. Are data retention policies defined and documented?
5. Have we communicated these policies to relevant stakeholders?

### Component Descriptions

#### Data/AI Strategy
Establish the fundamental vision and objectives for how data and AI will create value for the organization. This includes defining data principles, identifying strategic priorities, and creating a roadmap for data maturity.

#### Data Model Approach
Define the conceptual, logical, and physical data models that will structure your organization's data. Establish standards for data modeling and determine the approach for master and reference data.

#### Data Policies
Develop foundational policies for data management, covering areas such as data ownership, access, security, privacy, and retention. These policies set the ground rules for how data should be handled across the organization.

## Phase 2: Structure

### Self-Assessment
#### Catalog & Rollout
1. Have we selected an appropriate data catalog tool or approach?
2. Do we have a defined metadata management framework?
3. Have we established a process for maintaining catalog accuracy?
4. Are business glossaries integrated with our technical metadata?
5. Is our catalog accessible to all relevant stakeholders?

#### Controls
1. Have we implemented comprehensive data access controls?
2. Do we have mechanisms to track and audit data usage?
3. Are data validation rules consistently applied?
4. Have we established controls for sensitive data handling?
5. Do we regularly test the effectiveness of our data controls?

### Component Descriptions

#### Catalog & Rollout
Implement a data catalog solution to inventory and document data assets across the organization. Define metadata standards and begin the systematic cataloging of data sources, attributes, and definitions.

#### Controls
Establish governance controls to ensure data integrity, security, and compliance. This includes implementing access controls, validation rules, audit mechanisms, and compliance monitoring processes.

## Phase 3: Scale

### Self-Assessment
#### Data Quality
1. Have we defined key data quality dimensions and metrics?
2. Do we have automated data quality monitoring in place?
3. Are data quality issues tracked and remediated systematically?
4. Have we implemented data quality scorecards for critical data domains?
5. Do we have clear ownership for data quality improvement initiatives?

#### Data Mapping/Data Flow Diagram
1. Have we mapped data flows for all critical business processes?
2. Do our diagrams show data transformations and processing rules?
3. Can we trace data lineage from source to consumption?
4. Are data dependencies clearly documented?
5. Do we update flow diagrams when processes or systems change?

#### Data Stewardship
1. Have we defined clear roles and responsibilities for data stewards?
2. Do data stewards have adequate time and resources allocated?
3. Have we implemented a data stewardship training program?
4. Is there a governance body overseeing the stewardship program?
5. Do we measure and recognize effective data stewardship?

### Component Descriptions

#### Data Quality
Implement formal frameworks and processes for measuring, monitoring, and improving data quality. Establish data quality metrics, thresholds, and remediation procedures across the organization.

#### Data Mapping/Data Flow Diagram
Document the movement of data throughout the organization by creating comprehensive data flow diagrams. Map how data is created, transformed, and consumed across systems and processes.

#### Data Stewardship
Establish formal data stewardship roles and responsibilities across the organization. Implement training, communities of practice, and accountability mechanisms to ensure proper data management.

## Phase 4: AI Readiness

### Self-Assessment
#### Data Sufficiency/EDA
1. Do we systematically evaluate data sufficiency for planned AI use cases?
2. Have we established protocols for exploratory data analysis?
3. Can we identify and address data gaps before AI development begins?
4. Do we assess data for potential biases that could impact AI outcomes?
5. Have we implemented processes to validate that data is representative of real-world conditions?

### Component Descriptions

#### Data Sufficiency/EDA
Conduct systematic exploratory data analysis to assess whether data is sufficient in quality, quantity, and representativeness for AI/ML applications. Identify data gaps and develop strategies to address them.
