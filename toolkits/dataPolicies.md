# Data Policy Toolkit Guide

## Toolkit Overview

### What is this toolkit?
This toolkit provides a standardized approach for creating and implementing data policies that establish clear rules, responsibilities, and procedures for data management within your organization. It includes a structured template and process guidance designed specifically for enterprise AI initiatives.

### Why use it?
Ad-hoc, inconsistent approaches to data policy creation result in gaps, contradictions, and ineffective governance. This toolkit ensures your policies are comprehensive, practical, and actually used rather than filed away and forgotten. Well-crafted data policies reduce risk, accelerate AI development, and build trust with stakeholders.

### When to use it?
Use this toolkit:
- When establishing new data domains
- When onboarding data for AI use cases
- During regulatory compliance initiatives
- After governance incidents requiring policy adjustments
- During quarterly governance reviews

## How to Use

The policy development process follows five key phases:

1. **Identify Need**: Determine the specific policy need based on risk assessment, stakeholder input, or governance gaps.
   - Engage with business and technical stakeholders
   - Review existing policies to prevent duplication
   - Identify the specific behaviors you need to influence

2. **Draft Policy**: Use the template below to create an initial draft.
   - Focus on clarity and practicality over legalese
   - Include specific, measurable standards
   - Provide concrete examples relevant to your organization

3. **Review & Refine**: Circulate to key stakeholders for feedback.
   - Include technical teams who will implement the policy
   - Consider business impact and practicality
   - Validate with legal/compliance as needed
   - Iterate based on feedback

4. **Approve & Publish**: Obtain formal approval through your governance process.
   - Present to Data Governance Council
   - Store in accessible policy repository
   - Link from relevant tools and systems

5. **Implement & Monitor**: Deploy the policy with appropriate education and controls.
   - Conduct targeted training for affected teams
   - Implement technical controls where possible
   - Establish monitoring for compliance
   - Schedule periodic review dates

# [POLICY NAME]

## Policy Information
**Policy Owner:** [Name and role of individual accountable for this policy]  
**Last Updated:** [Date of last revision]  
**Review Frequency:** [Annual/Biannual/Quarterly]  
**Next Review Date:** [Date]  
**Approval:** [Governance body that approved]  

## Purpose and Scope
[Provide a clear, concise statement of why this policy exists and what it covers. Define explicitly what is in and out of scope. Limit to 2-3 paragraphs. Be specific about which data domains, systems, teams, or processes this policy governs.]

## Policy Statements
[List 3-7 clear, actionable policy statements that define what must or must not be done. Each statement should be specific enough to guide action but flexible enough to apply across different situations. Avoid vague language or aspirational statements.]

1. [Policy statement 1]
2. [Policy statement 2]
3. [Policy statement 3]

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| [Role 1] | [Clear list of what this role must do to comply with this policy] |
| [Role 2] | [Responsibilities for this role] |
| [Role 3] | [Responsibilities for this role] |

## Compliance and Monitoring
[Describe how compliance with this policy will be measured and monitored. Include specific metrics, audit procedures, or technical controls that will be implemented. Specify the consequences of non-compliance.]

## Exceptions Process
[Define the process for requesting exceptions to this policy. Include who can approve exceptions, what criteria will be used, how to submit requests, and how exceptions will be documented and reviewed.]

### Helper Text for Each Section

#### Policy Information
Clearly identify who owns this policy, when it was last updated, and the review cycle. The owner must have sufficient authority to enforce the policy and must actively manage it over time.

#### Purpose and Scope
Focus on the "why" behind this policy. Explain the risks it mitigates and the benefits it provides. Be explicit about what is covered and what is excluded to prevent scope creep or confusion.

#### Policy Statements
These are the core of your document. Each statement should be:
- Actionable (can be clearly implemented)
- Verifiable (compliance can be measured)
- Necessary (addresses a specific risk or requirement)
- Understandable (avoids jargon and legalese)

#### Roles and Responsibilities
Map specific responsibilities to defined roles rather than individuals. This ensures the policy remains valid despite organizational changes. Include both business and technical roles.

#### Compliance and Monitoring
Every policy needs teeth. Define specific mechanisms for ensuring compliance, whether technical controls, audit processes, or management reviews. Specify the frequency of monitoring activities.

#### Exceptions Process
No policy works in all situations. A clear exceptions process prevents teams from ignoring policies when they don't fit their needs. Document all exceptions and review them regularly.

#### Related Policies and Standards
Policies don't exist in isolation. Reference related policies to help users understand the broader governance landscape. Ensure no contradictions exist between related policies.

#### Definitions
Define domain-specific terms to ensure consistent interpretation. Be particularly careful to clarify terms that might have different meanings across business units.
