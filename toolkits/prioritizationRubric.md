## Overview
Picking which projects to work on can be the hardest parts for many organizations. 

## What is the AI Prioritization Rubric?
This toolkit provides a structured methodology for evaluating and prioritizing AI initiatives based on their potential business value, strategic alignment, and implementation feasibility. It equips leadership teams with a consistent, data-driven framework to make informed decisions about which AI projects to pursue. 

## Why use the AI Prioritization Rubric?
Defining how projects are approved helps gather the right information to work on the right projects that yield the most results. A structured and formal process provides the ability to maximize the  

## How to Implement 
Prioritization will ultimately become a stack rank or tradeoff decision between different option. Defining the dimensions and scoring creates a shared understanding of how to evaluate which projects to work on. Work backwards from the types of projects the business needs and the development team can deliver. 

1. Define the AI Strategy including goals and metrics for AI and data in your organization. 
2. Define the ideal projects your team is looking for to achieve those goals. 
3. Create a list of dimensions to prioritize and the criteria to score based on. Wherever possible, use strict criteria instead of scalar (1 to 5). For example, instead of business value from 1-5, use 1 = <$50K per year. 
4. Create an Intake Form to capture intiial information about a request. Capture enough information to know if it is worth following up. 
5. Create discovery questions to cpature during the intake Form or during a live conversation, depending on the expectations in your organization and the level of 'white glove' service your team is providing. 
6. Create

## Business Value

**Strategic Impact**

3: Directly supports core strategic initiative or major transformation
2: Supports secondary strategic objective
1: Limited or indirect strategic alignment

**Business Outcome Metric**
4: Revenue Impact >$5M annually OR Cost Reduction >$2M annually OR Significant Customer Experience improvement OR Critical Risk Reduction (regulatory/compliance requirement)
3: Revenue Impact $1M-$5M annually OR Cost Reduction $500K-$2M annually OR Moderate Customer Experience improvement OR Competitive necessity risk reduction
2: Revenue Impact $100K-$1M annually OR Cost Reduction $50K-$500K annually OR Minor Customer Experience improvement OR Operational risk mitigation
1: Revenue Impact <$100K annually OR Cost Reduction <$50K annually OR Minimal Customer Experience improvement OR Limited risk reduction

**Time to Value**
3: <3 months to realize benefits
2: 3-9 months to realize benefits
1: >9 months to realize benefits

## Feasibility

**Data Readiness**

3: Data available, clean, and accessible
2: Data available but requires preprocessing/integration
1: Significant data collection/quality efforts required

**Technical Complexity**
3: Uses established patterns with proven AI approaches
2: Requires moderate customization of existing techniques
1: Requires novel approaches or significant R&D


**Organizational Readiness**
3: Stakeholders aligned, adoption path clear
2: Some stakeholder buy-in, change management needed
1: Significant cultural/process barriers to overcome

## Intake Questions

1. Current Processes - what processes or activities will be impacted or changed? 
1. Users - who will leverage this solution? What teams or personas will want to use this?  
1. Value - how will this project add value (cost savings, revenue, customer experienece etc.)?
