# Data Model Strategy Toolkit

## Toolkit Overview

### What is this toolkit?
This toolkit provides a structured framework for evaluating, selecting, and implementing the right data architecture model for your organization. It helps leadership teams navigate the decision between modern approaches like medallion architecture, data mesh, data fabric, data lakehouse, and traditional data warehousing - based on business objectives, organizational structure, and technical capabilities.

### Why use it?
- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures your data architecture supports business objectives rather than creating technical debt
- **Future-Proofing**: Prevents costly architectural rework by considering scaling requirements upfront
- **Cross-Team Alignment**: Creates a shared understanding between business and technical stakeholders
- **Implementation Clarity**: Provides clear decision criteria and implementation roadmap
- **Governance Integration**: Embeds governance into architecture decisions from the start

### When to use it?
- When starting new data platform initiatives
- When facing scalability issues with current data architecture
- During cloud migration planning
- When experiencing data silos or cross-team collaboration issues
- When data engineering becomes a bottleneck for analytics or AI initiatives
- When considering modernization of legacy data warehouses

## How to Use

### Process Overview

1. **Preparation** (1-2 weeks)
   - Form a cross-functional evaluation team (data engineering, analytics, business stakeholders)
   - Gather current architecture documentation
   - Document current pain points and future requirements
   - Define evaluation criteria and weightings

2. **Architecture Education** (1 week)
   - Conduct knowledge-sharing sessions on key architectures
   - Review case studies from similar organizations
   - Invite vendor input where appropriate
   - Document pros/cons of each approach in your context

3. **Assessment Workshop** (1-2 days)
   - Score each architecture against weighted criteria
   - Identify potential hybrid approaches
   - Document trade-offs and risks
   - Reach preliminary recommendation

4. **Proof of Concept** (2-4 weeks)
   - Design limited-scope POC for 1-2 finalist architectures
   - Implement with representative data domains
   - Test against key requirements
   - Document learnings and refinements

5. **Final Selection & Roadmap** (1-2 weeks)
   - Formalize architecture decision
   - Create phased implementation plan
   - Develop governance approach
   - Define success metrics

### Key Principles for Selection

- **No Universal Solution**: There is no one-size-fits-all architecture; your business context matters most
- **Evolution Over Revolution**: Consider incremental transformation rather than big-bang changes
- **Team Structure Matters**: Your organizational structure should inform your architecture choice
- **Start with the Business**: Architecture should serve business needs, not the other way around
- **Consider Maturity**: Be honest about your organization's data maturity and technical capabilities
