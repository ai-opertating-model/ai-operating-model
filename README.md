Our goal is to democratize enterprise AI adoption by providing a comprehensive, open-source operating model that empowers organizations to deliver impactful AI solutions with confidence, speed, and responsibility in complex enterprise environments.

The AI operating model is a comprehensive framework that defines how an organization structures, governs, and scales its artificial intelligence initiatives to drive business value. Organizations are prioritizing these efforts:

- Define the organizational structure and relationship between the business units and central technical teams (e.g., federated, hub and spoke, etc.).
- Define and streamline the process across various teams, including the business, control teams (InfoSec, risk and compliance, etc.), and development teams.
- Implement AI strategy and show leadership maturity of capabilities and financial results

This framework bridges the gap between AI potential and enterprise reality, equipping teams with practical guidance, proven patterns, and governance frameworks that accelerate the journey from AI concept to value creation.

This operating model is open-source under the Apache 2.0 license. You are free to use, modify, and distribute this framework within your organization or client engagements. We believe that by sharing knowledge openly, we can collectively advance the field of enterprise AI and help organizations realize its transformative potential.

## Principles

This operating model is built around the following overarching assumptions about how AI needs to be successful in the enterprise.

### 1. Business Strategy Drives AI

Connect every AI initiative directly to financial returns. Validate innovation against tangible business metrics. Kill projects that lack clear paths to value creation. Measure implementation success against predetermined financial thresholds.

### 2. Product-First Approach

Treat AI as product solutions, not technology experiments. Start with customer problems, not algorithms. Define success metrics before implementation. Ship minimum viable products rapidly. Iterate based on measured outcomes, not technical elegance.

### 3. Data Foundation

Recognize data as the core enterprise asset controlling AI value creation. Map data lineage for every model. Implement data quality controls at source. Create federated governance that balances access with protection. Bias detection requires historical context visibility.

### 4. Built-in Governance

Implement guardrails, not roadblocks. Design risk controls proportional to impact assessment. Build model monitoring into deployment pipelines. Create clear accountability for model performance. Establish rapid remediation protocols for drift detection.

## AI Operating Model Structure
This is an overview of the life cycle and components to implement an operating model

This operating model is organized to be practical and applicable across many organizations.
![Uploading aiOperatingModel.jpgâ€¦]()

- **Programs** - runbooks across capabilities to create components of the AI life cycle. These are specific paths and implementation guides for an outcome.
- **Capabilities** - the combination of processes, people, and technology to accomplish portions of the AI lifecycle. 
- **AI Life Cycle** - the standard/common process projects flow through with best practices.
- **Components** - steps in the life cycle or activities for the life cycle to apply capabilities. 
- **Templates** - specific templates to use for each project or component 

## Programs

The operating model is organized with specific paths for organizations to implement based on their priorities and needs. You can think of these as paths for specific outcomes through the various resources in this framework.

### Establishing the AI Operating Model

Establish the operating model for cross-functional teams through standardized processes and tooling. Define team interfaces, decision rights, and escalation paths. Implement collaborative workspaces with real-time visibility. Establish shared metrics that drive coordinated execution.

### AI Ideation

Implement structured collection, evaluation, and prioritization of AI use cases. Enforce business case validation before resource allocation. Apply standardized scoring frameworks across business units. Create visible idea portfolios with status tracking.

### AI Governance

Deploy centralized controls with distributed implementation authority. Establish risk tiers with corresponding control requirements. Automate compliance verification in deployment pipelines. Create transparent reporting on model performance and compliance status.

### Build vs. Buy

Develop clear evaluation frameworks for make-vs-buy decisions. Identify which capabilities provide competitive advantage versus which can be commoditized. Seek comprehensive reference architectures during vendor evaluation. Ensure alignment between vendor offerings and your governance requirements.

### AI Command Center

Build executive dashboards showing portfolio health, velocity, and outcomes. Implement leading indicators for investment effectiveness. Track model decay against prediction benchmarks. Monitor resource allocation against business unit priorities.

### Data Governance System

Establish data quality standards for model training. Create ownership and stewardship roles across functions. Implement metadata repositories with business context. Deploy data quality monitoring with automated alerting.

## About this Operating Model

### How to Contribute

We're actively seeking contributions to enhance and evolve this framework. As an open-source project, we believe that diverse perspectives and experiences will make this operating model more robust, practical, and widely applicable.

- **Refine Existing Content**: Help improve clarity, accuracy, and practicality of current guidance
- **Add Case Studies**: Share anonymized real-world examples that illustrate principles in action
- **Expand Implementation Guidance**: Contribute templates, checklists, or methodologies.
- **Suggest New Components**: Identify gaps in the framework that should be addressed.
- **Join Slack**: join the conversation and debate.  

For more information or to discuss potential contributions, please contact.

### Roadmap 
This is our plan to develop and publish this operating model
- **Prototype** - you're looking at it. We want to create the initial structure and seed content for contributors to provide feedback on how to create it. The focus will be on the AI Operating Model and the Data Governance programs. 
- **MVP** - the initial version for early adopting enterprise teams to field test and provide feedback on the structure and effectiveness. The focus will be on AI Ideation and AI Command Center Programs. 
- **V1** - the hardened and validated version of the operating model for mass publication and sharing.
